Poets and their Metrical Styles

Scattered notes for now. This will be organized better later.

Hexameter Laws
++++++++++++++

Summarized from Oswald, S. (2014). "Metrical Laws," in *Encyclopedia of Ancient Greek Language and Linguistics*. Leiden: Brill.

Varro's Law (cf. Gell. NA 18.15)
    A word break after the third longum is frequent ("masculine" penthemimeral caesura).
    We may amend this law to acknowledge a break after the third trochee ("feminine" penthemimeral caesura) is also common.
    Such caesuras occur in about 98% of lines.
Heinsius' Law
    Word break after the fourth metron is common (the "bucolic" diaeresis, because Heinsius' study focused on Theocritus)
Hermann's Law (Hermann's Bridge)
    A word break after the fourth trochee is uncommon, and incresingly less common in later poets.
Gerhard's Law
    Punctuation rarely follows the princeps in the fifth metron, and never follows the metron itself.
    West gives a fuller schematization of sense-pauses in various positions.
Wernicke's Law
    When a word break coincides with the end of a spondaic fourth metron, the final vowel is long
    by nature, not by position. Conversely, a word ending -VC, where V is a short vowel, is avoided
    in the fourth metron when the next word begins with a C. A similar rule applies in the second 
    metron, but less stringently so.
Meyer's First Law (Meyer's Bridge)
    A word beginning in the first foot should not end with the second trochee. (more often Hellenistic)
Giseke's Law
    Words beginning in the first foot should not end with the second (more often Hellenistic)
Naeke's Law
    Word break after a spondaic fourth metron is avoided (more often Hellenistic)
Hilberg's Law
    Word break after a spondaic second metron is avoided (more often Hellenistic)
Meyer's Second Law
    Words of iambic shape are avoided before masculine caesura (more often Hellenistic)
Meyer's Third Law
    A line avoids having a caesura in both the third and fifth foot (more often Hellenistic)
Tiedke's Law (Meyer's Fourth Law)
    A line avoids having a word break after both the fourth and fifth longum in the same line.
Independent monosyllable
    A monosyllable that is neither appositive nor preceded 
    by appositives, when placed at verse-end, is usually preceded by a choriambic 
    metrical unit (or word), by a bucolic diaeresis, and by an uncontracted fourth biceps.


Spondaic lines
++++++++++++++
A few poets who are identified for a taste in spondaic hexameters: Aratus, Eratosthenes, Moschus, Euphorion, Theocritus




Nonnus of Panopolis
+++++++++++++++++++

I used Nonnus for the basic tests of surface-mapping the structures
of hexameters, since the metrical structures of his lines are almost
always identical with the surface-level interpretation of syllables.
Correption, synaloephe, synizesis, and hiatus are almost non-existant.

All of Nonnus' verses follow only 9 patterns of syllables (a tenth pattern
appears only twice)::

            Dion.           Par.
            %               %
    ddddd   38.07 I         35.70 I
    dsddd   23.32 II        21.37 II
    dddsd   14.45 III       11.70 IV
    dsdsd   8.97 IV         6.97 V
    sdddd   8.54 V          14.45 III*
    sddsd   3.56 VI         5.24 VI
    ddsdd   2.16 VII        2.51 VII
    sdsdd   0.50 VIII       1.40 VIII
    dssdd   0.43 IX         0.66 IX

    [*] In the Paraphrasis, this pattern accommodates many Semitic names 
    that would ill fit elsewhere in the hexameter.

Note that:
- Holodactylic lines are prevalent, and tend to gather into clusters in the text.
- The first five patterns account for 90% of the hexameters.
- No pattern has more than two spondees.
- No pattern has a spondaic 5th foot (a "spondaic hexameter" popular among some Hellenistic poets)
- Only the rarest pattern allows two consecutive spondees, and they are broken by
a penthemimeral caesura.

Of those after Nonnus, most seem to have been influenced by his style: 
Christodotus, Pampreius, Musaeus, Paulus Silentarius, John of Gaza, Colluthus. 
Contra: the archaizing style of the Metaphrase of the Psalms in Homeric hexameters.
