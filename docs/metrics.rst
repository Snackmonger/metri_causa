The meeting of vowels
---------------------

Summarized from West (1982). *Greek Metre*. Oxford: Clarendon.

Elision
+++++++
Short final vowels disappear before an initial vowel. In edited 
texts, this is almost invariably indicated with an apostrophe; in inscriptions,
the elided vowel is often written in full and must be inferred.

Correption
++++++++++
A long vowel, diphthong, or triphthong (e.g. -ehi, -ewi), 
especially at word-end, is sometimes shortened before another vowel.

At word-end, this is commonest in early epic and elegy; it also occurs to some
extend in later hexameters and elegiacs and in lyric (in drama particularly in
Sophocles). The shortened syllable is practically always preceded or followed
by a naturally short syllable. In some cases, correption of multiple successive
syllables takes place: αἰαῖ αἰαῖ ai)ai= ai)ai= > -- -+.

Correption within a word is often disguised by spelling (e.g. nh=es > ne/es). 

Synecphonesis
+++++++++++++
Two or more vowels are slurred together to make one long syllable. Within the 
word, this is common where the first vowel is epsilon (or in Laconian, iota), 
but is also found with other vowels. In some dialects, these appear in places
where other dialects have contractions.


Consonantalization of iota or upsilon
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Occasionally occurs beween a consonant and another vowel in the same word,
especially to accommodate a name.

Hiatus
++++++
Both vowels retain their face values. This is unusual at word-juncture. Epic 
and elegiac poets admit it, especially at certain points in the line; many 
examples, however, involve words originally beginning with the consonant
digamma.
