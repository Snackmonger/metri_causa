Scansion Tool for Ancient Greek Poetry
======================================

The program is meant to aid in the analysis and composition of Greek poetry.
On the one hand, it should be able to parse the syllable structure of Greek poetry
into metrical cola, but it should also be able to analyse the adherance of those
cola to given metrical constraints (trimeter and hexameter mostly). It should be
able to search a corpus of poetry to find cola that will fit a requested pattern.

See ``docs/devlog.rst`` for progress.
